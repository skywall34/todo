Welcome to the TODO git repository! This repository contains the source code for the TODO web application, which is written in Rust and uses the Rocket web framework and the Diesel ORM.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure that you have the following software installed on your system:

- Git
- Rust (version 1.31 or higher)
- A web browser
- A text editor

You will also need to install the following Rust dependencies:

- Rocket
- Diesel
- Diesel Postgres Connection
- Serde

You can install these dependencies by adding the following lines to your Cargo.toml file:

```rust
[dependencies]
diesel = "1.4.1"
diesel_cli = { version = "2.0.1", default-features = false, features = ["postgres"] }
dotenvy = "0.15.6"
rocket = { version = "0.5.0-rc.2", features = ["json"] }
rocket_sync_db_pools = { version = "0.1.0-rc.2", features = ["diesel_postgres_pool"] }
serde = "1.0.152"
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the TODO web application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo.git
```

2. Change into the repository directory:

```bash
$ cd todo
```

3. Create a new database file using Postgres:

```bash
$ sqlite3 todos.db
```

4. Run the database migration to create the necessary tables:

```bash
$ diesel migration run
```

5. Start the Rocket server:

```bash
$ cargo run
```

This will start the Rocket server and serve the TODO web application on http://localhost:8000. You can now open the web application in your web browser and start using it.

## Testing
To run the test suite for the TODO web application, use the following command:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

This will run all of the tests in the tests directory and report any failures.

## Deployment

To deploy the TODO web application to a production environment, use the following command to build a release version of the application:

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

This will create a production-ready build of the TODO web application in the target/release directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your production server.
